;;; Commentary:

;; Open a new buffer, insert the contents of another file like this:
;;
;;     M-: (mf/insert-mirror "~/.emacs.d/init.el" 30 39)
;;
;; which would insert the lines 30-39 in the file `~/.emacs.d/init.el`.
;;
;; You can then repeat that to get multiple files in the buffer. You can also
;; edit the block, and the changes will be mirrored instantly in the other file.
;;
;; *Be careful!* Right now the mirror only works one way. Changes in the original files
;; are not currently mirrored into the multi-file. So any changes might be lost if you're
;; switching back and forth.
;;
;; This should be fixable, but this is all I have time for tonight.
